Creating and inserting and schemas


- Create a new database in a file called or byte.db containing a single table called student_scores, with a single field called reading, and inserts 100,000 random numbers between 10.0 and 25.0. How long does it take this program to run? 

- Create a new database called backup_byte.db with the same structure as byte.db and copies all the values greater than 20.0 from byte.db to backup.db.

- Create a database with a schema appropriate for an e-commerce website. You should have two tables Customers and Orders. The following columns are available, place them in the appropriate tables (Address, Customer_email, date_placed, Customer_ID,Order_products, Amount,Customer_phone, Order_ID ). In each table, choose or create the appropriate primary and foreign keys keeping in mind you would want to query and analyse data from these tables.
